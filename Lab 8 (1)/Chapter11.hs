-- Create some lists of numbers of different lengths such as:
twoValueList = Value 10 $ Value 20 Empty

-- Use <$> on the lists with a single-parameter function, such as:
plusTwo = (+2)

-- Use <$> and <*> on the lists with a binary function

-- Create some lists of binary functions

-- Use <*> on the binary functions list and the number lists
